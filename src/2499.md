# JP 2499 DRT

2499 is an Image Formation system originally built for Davinci Resolve. Checkout the [project's github repo](https://github.com/JuanPabloZambrano/DCTL/tree/main/2499_DRT).

Cameras capture light as data that can't be directly seen as an image, this data needs to be "formed" into an image.
Forming an image is a complex topic because of its inherent need to be based on aesthetics, this makes it extremely subjective.
This goes back to the way film base systems, each company had to make both aesthetic desition and balance them to technical in order to create their own recipes.
