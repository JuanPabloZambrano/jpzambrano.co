# JP 2499 DRT

2499 is an Image Formation system originally built for Davinci Resolve. Checkout the [project's github repo](https://github.com/JuanPabloZambrano/DCTL/tree/main/2499_DRT).

Cameras capture light as data that can't be directly seen as an image, this data needs to be "formed" into an image.
Image formation is a complex topic due of its dependence on aesthetic considerations, making it highly subjective.
This parallels the era of film-based systems, where each manufacturer had to balance aesthetic choices with technical constraints to develop their own unique processing formulas.
